<h1>Anatomy & Biology</h1>
<h2>Height & Weight: </h2>
<p>We compare sloths by how long they are, not how tall! The grow from 60 to 80 cm (24 to 31 in) long and, depending on the species, weigh from 3.6 to 7.7 kg (7.9 to 17.0 lb)</p>
<h2>Lifespan: </h2>
This is actually completely unknown in the wild due to a lack of studies but the median life expectancy in human care is about 16 years, with one individual at the Smithsonian Institution's National Zoo was as old as 49 years old
<h2>Unique physical characteristics: </h2>
<p>Poor hearing, they use smell and touch to find food. Their hair grows opposite the normal direction. There are several types, some have two toes, some have three toes</p>
<h2>Breathe:</h2>
<p>They can hold their breath underwater for up to 40 minutes but otherwise breathe normally</p>



<h1>Animal Behavior:</h1>
<h2>Sleeping Habits:</h2>
<p>Three toed sloths are mostly nocturnal and spend 90% of their time motionless. Two toed sloths are nocturnal.</p>
<h2>Protection from Predators:</h2>
<p>Algae grows in its hair providing natural camouflage. The fact that they move so slowly also provides protection from predators</p>
<h2>Food gathering:</h2>
<p>They use smell and touch to find food</p>
